# Prerequisites

This section will talk about how to get the required application and source before you can start. If you happened to have the following applications installed, you can skip this section. 
## Virtual Box

First of all you need to install VirtualBox on your computer. This can be easily done by downloading the application from their websites or using a package manager tool like homebrew. 

### Step by step instruction

1. Visit virtual box org [website][] and select `OS X hosts` to download the VirtualBox installing application. <br><br>

<br><br>

2. Once the downloading is finished, you should have a dmg format file like the picture below. Double clicking this file to start the installation. Keep selecting continue until the installation is finished. <br>

<br><br>

## Minix3 source

Minix3 is a free and open-source operating system. Its source file can be downloaded from this [link][]. In this instruction, we will use version 3.3.0 (stable release) ISO Image. Once the downloading is finished, you should have a file named minix_Rxxx.iso. (xxx is the version number you download).

<br><br>

# Loading Image

1. Now we have all the martials we need to start the installation. Let's go ahead and load the Minix3 image into the Virtual Box. Open the Virtual Box application. If you can not find it, press F4 to enter the application page and use the search bar at the top to locate Virtual Box.  <br>

<br><br>

2. Click new button on the top left of the window to create a new virtual machine. You can use whatever name you want, in this case we will just name it Minix3. Choose the type to be `Other` and the version to be `Other/Unknown`. Click continue. <br>

<br><br> 

3. Virtual Box will keep asking you to select the hardware spec for your virtual machine. You can set up the hardware as you like, but we recommend you not to change the default value too much. The following table can be used as a reference. Be aware that the minimum memory that minix3 need is 64MB.  <br>

    Hardware | Value
    ------------ | -------------
    Memory size | 128 MB
    Hard disk | Create a virtual hard disk now
    Hard disk file type | VHD (Virtual Hard Disk)
    Storage on physical hard disk | Dynamically allocated
<br><br>    

4. Now you should be able to see your new virtual machine on the left column of the Virtual Box. <br><br>

<br><br>    

5. Select the virtual machine you just created, click `Setting` which is a yellow gear icon on top left of the windows. In the setting page, go to `Storage` section and click little CD icon that follow `Empty`. On the Attributes subsection, click another CD icon and select `Choose Virtual Optical Disk File`. <br>

<br><br>

6. On the windows that popped up, find the minix3 ISO file you downloaded in the previous step and open it. Now you successfully load the Minix3 image into the virtual machine you just created.  <br><br>

# Installation 

1. Go back to the Virtual BoxÂ main windows, select the virtual machine you created. You should be able to find the start button on the top left of the windows, click it to start the minix3. <br>

<br><br>

2. Virtual Box will automatically load the image file from disk and give you couple options regarding booting procedure. Let's press `Enter` to start minix regularly. <br>

3. Minix will ask you for the login name. Since you haven't created an account yet, let's use root to enter the root node. Once you login into the system, type setup to configure the Minix system setup.   <br>

4. Minix3 will prompt you more questions about the hardware spec you want to use. You can choose the value that best suits your need, but if you are not sure what you want, press Enter to choose the default value. There are a few tips we want to give in case you run in any unexpected situation.  <br>
	- If the screen blanks, press CTRL+F3 to select "software scrolling"<br>
	- If things go wrong, press CTRL+C to abort and start over.<br>
	<br><br>

5. The installation is going to take a while, you can monitor the progress by looking at the number of remaining files. Once the installation is finished, type shutdown to exit the system.<br>

6. The last step of installation is removing installation media. This way Minix won't load image on startup every time.  You can do that by following the same procedure as loading the image but select `Remove Disk from Virtual Drive` instead of `Choose Virtual Optical Disk File` <br>
